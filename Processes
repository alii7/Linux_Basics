"Daemon" is a process that runs in the background, usually waiting for something to happen that it is capable of working with.

Background and suspended processes are usually manipulated via job number (job ID). This number is different from the process ID and is used because it is shorter.
In addition, a job can consist of multiple processes running in a series or at the same time, in parallel. Using the job ID is easier than tracking individual processes.
